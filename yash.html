        <h1>5 FACTS ABOUT ART</h1>

            <h1>
                1. Art used to be an Olympic event
            </h1>
            <p>The Olympics wasn’t always about abs and doping scandals. The founder of the modern Games, the Baron Pierre de Coubertin, was enamoured with the idea of the true Olympian being a talented artist and sportsperson. Thanks to him, between 1912
                and 1948 medals were given out for sporting-inspired masterpieces of architecture, music, painting, sculpture and literature.

            <h1>2. The Mona Lisa has her own mailbox in the Louvre because of all the love letters she receives</h1><br>
            <p>Over the years many have fallen prey to the portrait’s ‘limpid and burning eyes’, leaving her offerings of flowers, poems and, yes, love notes. Artist Luc Maspero allegedly took this fervour to a new high – and then low – in 1852, diving off
                a hotel balcony because “For years I have grappled desperately with her smile. I prefer to die.” Who knew art appreciation could be so dark?</p><br>

            <h1>3. The colour wheel predates the United States</h1><br>
            <p>Considering the US is one of the oldest modern democracies, this is pretty amazing. Sir Isaac Newton invented the colour wheel in 1706 by refracting white sunlight into its six colours. The realisation that light alone was responsible for
                colour was radical, and the wheel proved especially useful for artists, who could now easily observe the most effective colour complementation.</p><br>

            <h1>4. Artist Willard Wigan once inhaled his own work</h1><br>
            <p>What’s that, you say? He inhaled a painting?? The man must be enormous! Not quite. Wigan’s works are ‘micro-sculptures’, so tiny they must be viewed through a microscope. In creating his art, Wigan has to slow his heartbeat and work between
                pulses. The work he inhaled was Alice, from Alice in Wonderland, but apparently she was even better when remade.

            <h1>5. In 2003 street artist Banksy stuck his own work to the wall in the Tate Modern Museum.</h1><br>
            <p>The prank was soon undone by its inadequate glue, but for a few hours Crimewatch UK Has Ruined the Countryside For All of Us was hung in one of the world’s most famous museums. It also inspired Andrzej Sobiepan, a Polish art student, to a
                similar feat in 2005, where for three days he successfully passed off his work as part of the National Museum’s collection.

                <h1>Andy Warhol</h1>
                <H6>Beginning out as a commercial artist, he brought the ethos of promotion into fine art, even going so far as to say, “Making money is art.” Such attitudes blew away the existential declarations of Abstract Expressionism. Although he’s recognized
                    for captions such as Campbell’s Soup, Marilyn Monroe, and Elvis Presley, his greatest invention was himself.

                <H1>Pablo Picasso</H1>
                <H6>Pablo Picasso is implicitly synonymous with modern art, and it doesn’t hurt that he fits the generally held image of the fugitive genius whose goals are balanced by a taste for living big. He turned the field of art history with radical
                    innovations that include college and Cubism, which destroyed the stranger.

                <H6>Van Gogh is known for being psychologically unstable, but his arts are among the most popular and most famous artists of all time. Van Gogh’s technique of painting with flurries of thick brushstrokes made up of vivid colours squeezed straight
